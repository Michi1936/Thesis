@article{Yang2017,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel pairwise-force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH) model to enable simulation of various interactions at interfaces in real time. Realistic capture of interactions at interfaces is a challenging problem for SPH-based simulations, especially for scenarios involving multiple interactions at different interfaces. Our PF-SPH model can readily handle multiple types of interactions simultaneously in a single simulation; its basis is to use a larger support radius than that used in standard SPH. We adopt a novel anisotropic filtering term to further improve the performance of interaction forces. The proposed model is stable; furthermore, it avoids the particle clustering problem which commonly occurs at the free surface. We show how our model can be used to capture various interactions. We also consider the close connection between droplets and bubbles, and show how to animate bubbles rising in liquid as well as bubbles in air. Our method is versatile, physically plausible and easy-to-implement. Examples are provided to demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of our approach.},

@article{Monaghan2005,
abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics (Lucy 1977, Gingold {\&} Monaghan 1977). We wanted a method that was easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy. The SPH method satisfied these require- ments. As a bonus we found the SPH was rugged, gave sensible answers in difficult situations, and could be extended to complicated physics with- out much trouble. The SPH method is a particle method. Unlike the particle in cell method (PIC) (Harlow 1957, 1974, 1988), SPH does not need a grid to calculate spatial derivatives. Instead, they are found by analytical differentiation of interpolation formulae. The equations of momentum and energy become sets of ordinary differential equations which are easy to understand in mechanical and thermodynamical terms. For example, the pressure gradi- ent becomes a force between pairs of particles. The astrophysicist can then use intuition in a way which is difficult with the original partial differential equations. This intuition, coupled with detailed analysis, has allowed SPH to be extended to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. Although very accurate finite-difference methods exist-and these are better than SPH for some problems-they cannot handle complex physics in three dimensions with the same ease. Various aspects of SPH have been reviewed by Monaghan (1985, 1988a) and Benz (1988, 1989).},
