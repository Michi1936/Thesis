abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel pairwise-force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH) model to enable simulation of various interactions at interfaces in real time. Realistic capture of interactions at interfaces is a challenging problem for SPH-based simulations, especially for scenarios involving multiple interactions at different interfaces. Our PF-SPH model can readily handle multiple types of interactions simultaneously in a single simulation; its basis is to use a larger support radius than that used in standard SPH. We adopt a novel anisotropic filtering term to further improve the performance of interaction forces. The proposed model is stable; furthermore, it avoids the particle clustering problem which commonly occurs at the free surface. We show how our model can be used to capture various interactions. We also consider the close connection between droplets and bubbles, and show how to animate bubbles rising in liquid as well as bubbles in air. Our method is versatile, physically plausible and easy-to-implement. Examples are provided to demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of our approach.},

@article{Monaghan2005,
abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics (Lucy 1977, Gingold {\&} Monaghan 1977). We wanted a method that was easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy. The SPH method satisfied these require- ments. As a bonus we found the SPH was rugged, gave sensible answers in difficult situations, and could be extended to complicated physics with- out much trouble. The SPH method is a particle method. Unlike the particle in cell method (PIC) (Harlow 1957, 1974, 1988), SPH does not need a grid to calculate spatial derivatives. Instead, they are found by analytical differentiation of interpolation formulae. The equations of momentum and energy become sets of ordinary differential equations which are easy to understand in mechanical and thermodynamical terms. For example, the pressure gradi- ent becomes a force between pairs of particles. The astrophysicist can then use intuition in a way which is difficult with the original partial differential equations. This intuition, coupled with detailed analysis, has allowed SPH to be extended to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. Although very accurate finite-difference methods exist-and these are better than SPH for some problems-they cannot handle complex physics in three dimensions with the same ease. Various aspects of SPH have been reviewed by Monaghan (1985, 1988a) and Benz (1988, 1989).},

abstract = {We present a weakly compressible form of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method (SPH) for fluid flow based on the Tait equation. In contrast to commonly employed projection approaches that strictly enforce incompressibility, time-consuming solvers for the Poisson equation are avoided by allowing for small, user-defined density fluctuations. We also discuss an improved surface tension model that is particularly appropriate for single-phase free-surface flows. The proposed model is compared to existing models and experiments illustrate the accuracy of the approach for free surface flows. Combining the proposed methods, volume-preserving low-viscosity liquids can be efficiently simulated using SPH. The approach is appropriate for medium-scale and small-scale phenomena. Effects such as splashing and breaking waves are naturally handled.},

@article{Koshizuka1998,
abstract = {The numerical method used in this study is the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method, which is based on particles and their interactions. The particle number density is implicitly required to be constant to satisfy incompressibility. A semi-implicit algorithm is used for two-dimensional incompressible non-viscous flow analysis. The particles whose particle number densities are below a set point are considered as on the free surface. Grids are not necessary in any calculation steps. It is estimated that most of computation time is used in generation of the list of neighboring particles in a large problem. An algorithm to enhance the computation speed is proposed. The MPS method is applied to numerical simulation of breaking waves on slopes. Two types of breaking waves, plunging and spilling breakers, are observed in the calculation results. The breaker types are classified by using the minimum angular momentum at the wave front. The surf similarity parameter which separates the types agrees well with references. Breaking waves are also calculated with a passively moving float which is modelled by particles. Artificial friction due to the disturbed motion of particles causes errors in the flow velocity distribution which is shown in comparison with the theoretical solution of a cnoidal wave.},

@article{Truscott2012,
abstract = {We present a study of the forces during free-surface water entry of spheres of varying masses, diameters, and surface treatments. Previous studies have shown that the formation of a subsurface air cavity by a falling sphere is conditional upon impact speed and surface treatment. This study focuses on the forces experienced by the sphere in both cavity-forming and non-cavity-forming cases. Unsteady force estimates require accurate determination of the deceleration for both high and low mass ratios, especially as inertial and hydrodynamic effects approach equality. Using high-speed imaging, high-speed particle image velocimetry, and numerical simulation, we examine the nature of the forces in each case. The effect of mass ratio is shown, where a lighter sphere undergoes larger decelerations and more dramatic trajectory changes. In the non-cavity-forming cases, the forces are modulated by the growth and shedding of a strong, ring-like vortex structure. In the cavity-forming cases, little vorticity is shed by the sphere, and the forces are modulated by the unsteady pressure required for the opening and closing of the air cavity. A data-driven boundary-element-type method is developed to accurately describe the unsteady forces using cavity shape data from experiments. 1. Introduction The impact of a solid sphere with a free surface of water can create an air cavity depending on the initial conditions and surface treatment. The forces acting on the sphere after impact are dictated by the cavity dynamics, or lack thereof, and the relative magnitude of the inertial force compared to the unsteady hydrodynamic forces. Experimental measurement of these forces has proven difficult for distances greater than one-half diameter beneath the surface because direct measurement via a force gauge is not feasible, and indirect measurement from position data requires highly accurate imaging and data processing techniques. The complexity of the water entry problem has provided many opportunities for independent study. Phenomena studied in some detail include the initially small but fast jet that is ejected out below the sphere at the moment of impact with the free surface (Thoroddsen et al. 2004), the cavity ripples associated with the portion of the cavity that descends with the sphere after deep seal (cavity pinch-off) (Grumstrup,},
